          <p>This application is in alpha, which means it's our very first release. Because the application is brand new, brittle, and likely to have bugs, we'd like to offer you an extremely discounted rate on advertising ($1/day), to thank you for testing it and to make up for any potential inconveniences that may occur.</p>
